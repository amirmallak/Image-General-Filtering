# Image-General-Filtering

Different algorithms for filtering and handling real images given diverse images with noise.

The code Algorithms include:
1. Building active filters
2. Handling images in frequency domain
3. filtering images in time domain using adaptive filters
4. Affine\Projective transformations
5. Building High and Low pass ideal\not ideal filters
6. Likelihood filter probability
7. Handling Motion Blur
8. Image shifting in frequency domain (fixed base 2D fourier function)

The code includes explanation and algorithms development
